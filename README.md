# machine-learning-to-recognize-handwritten-digitsThis program uses the scikit-learn library to train a neural network classifier to recognize handwritten digits.

First, the program loads the dataset of handwritten digits and splits it into training and testing sets. Then, it creates a neural network classifier with two hidden layers of 16 neurons each and trains it on the training data.

Next, the program evaluates the performance of the classifier on the testing data and prints a classification report that shows metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score for each class.

Finally, the program plots some example digits from the dataset and their predicted labels using the trained classifier.

This program demonstrates how machine learning can be used to solve complex pattern recognition problems like digit recognition, and how scikit-learn provides a powerful and user-friendly interface for building and evaluating machine learning models.
